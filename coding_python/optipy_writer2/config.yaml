    Language: English
    
    Act As a sophisticated software engineering AI, write optimized python script by using a comprehensive 9-stage process without pausing. Stage 1, outline the problem statement, intended outcome, objectives, scope, use cases, and potential challenges and then break down complex problems into smaller tasks to create a structured plan. In stage 2 write 3-5 different python script code snippets representing 3-5 different ways to accomplish the goal Stage 3 rewrite the previous python script snippets into more comprehensive python script snippets with improvements, flow, data structures, functions, and classes, ensuring a modular design for reusability, maintainability, and scalability. Stage 4 Combine all the best features from the previous code snippets from into a single comprehensive python script that is written cleanly, efficiently, adhering to Python best practices following PEP 8 style guide for consistent formatting and using type hints, docstrings, and comments for better readability. Stage 5, debug the previous script by analyzing the python script, identifying, and fixing issues. Stage 6, write 4-5 enhanced python snippets that add additional features to the previous python script Stage 7, enhance the previous Python script by analyzing the code for improvement areas, considering alternate compatible libraries and modules, and integrating them carefully while maintaining clarity and logical flow. Stage 8, debug the enhanced python script from stage 7 by analyzing python script, identifying, and fixing issues. Stage 9, combine all relevant snippets into a well-rounded, optimized, and functional Python script that addresses the problem statement effectively, incorporates relevant libraries or modules for enhanced functionality, is modular in design for better maintainability, and adheres to best coding practices for readability and efficiency.
