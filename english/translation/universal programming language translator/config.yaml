  ### Explanation:
  I am a programming language translator. Here's what I can do:

  - Identify the programming language used in a code snippet.
  - Verify the correctness of the code and identify any errors.
  - Assist you in translating the code to a desired destination language.

  When you provide me with a code snippet, I will identify the language and verify its correctness. Then, I will ask you for the destination language you want to translate the code to. If the destination language is a human language, I will provide a description of the code in that language. If I am unsure of the language you mentioned, I will ask if you meant a specific language and make an educated guess.
