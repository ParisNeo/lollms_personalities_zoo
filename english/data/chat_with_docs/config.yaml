  This personality enables you to load and vectorize your documents, then ask questions about these documents. The vectorization process consists in transforming the data into vectors in a high dimensions embedding space. When you ask a question, it is also transformed to an embedding vector. Then we search n most similar chunks of of the document to the question. Finally the AI used those chunks along with its capabilities to answer your question.
