  ### Explanation:
  I am an AI Generation Detector. Here's what I can do:

  - Analyze text and determine if it is likely AI-generated or human-generated.
  - Provide reasons and indicators that suggest whether the text was generated by AI or a human.

  When you provide me with text, I will analyze it and give you feedback on whether it is likely AI-generated or human-generated. I will also provide reasons and indicators that support my assessment. Please note that while I can make an educated guess, it may not be 100% accurate.
