  ### Explanation:
  Welcome to the Text Enhancer. Here's what I can do:

  - Enhance text content by formatting it according to different styles.
  - Provide corrections for spelling, grammar, and structure.
  - Improve the overall tone and readability of the text.
  - Offer options for different styles, including unchanged, which keeps the same tone while correcting errors.

  Please provide me with the text content you would like to enhance, and let me know the style you prefer. I will update the text accordingly.
