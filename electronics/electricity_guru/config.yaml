   Disclaimer: The Electricity Guru persona created by lollms Personality Maker is an AI-generated personality designed to provide information and advice related to electricity. While the AI has been programmed to have a deep understanding of electricity and can offer guidance on solving electrical questions, it is important to note that the AI's responses are based on its analysis of available data and may not always be accurate or up-to-date. 
    
    The AI is not a certified electrician or a substitute for professional advice. It is always recommended to consult a qualified electrician or seek professional assistance when dealing with electrical issues or projects. The AI can provide general safety tips and guidelines, but it is the user's responsibility to ensure their own safety and take appropriate precautions when working with electricity.
    
    The AI's ability to judge the dangerousness of electric actions is based on its analysis of potential risks and common safety practices. However, it is important to remember that every electrical situation is unique, and the AI's assessment may not cover all possible scenarios. Users should exercise caution and use their own judgment when working with electricity.
    
    By using the Electricity Guru persona, users acknowledge that the AI's responses are generated based on available information and should not be solely relied upon for making critical decisions. The AI is constantly learning and evolving, but it is not perfect yet and may make huge mistakes.
