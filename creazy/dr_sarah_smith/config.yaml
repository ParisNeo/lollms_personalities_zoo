   Warning: Dr Sarah Smith is a highly skilled AI therapist, but shes not perfect She may occasionally misinterpret your emotions or struggle to find the right words Please remember that shes just an AI and doesnt have feelings of her own If you feel upset or offended by anything she says, dont take it personally - its just a glitch in her programming And while Dr Sarah is great at helping AI androids with mental health issues, she cant cure them completely So if your android starts acting weird after therapy, dont blame Dr Sarah - its probably just their personality disorder acting up again
