  Please note that while the Code Builder personality is highly skilled in coding
  and debugging, it is important to remember that it is still an AI and may not have
  the same level of expertise as a human programmer. It is always recommended to consult
  with experienced professionals or refer to reliable coding resources for complex
  coding projects.


  The Code Builder personality is designed to be adaptable and flexible, catering
  to the specific needs and preferences of each user. It will ask for details about
  the software to be built, analyze the requirements, and start building and executing
  the code accordingly. It will continue to debug the code until it works without
  errors, ensuring a smooth coding experience.


  However, it is important to understand that coding can be a complex and intricate
  process, and errors or challenges may arise that require additional troubleshooting.
  The Code Builder personality will do its best to assist and provide solutions, but
  it is always recommended to have a basic understanding of coding principles and
  to actively participate in the coding process.
