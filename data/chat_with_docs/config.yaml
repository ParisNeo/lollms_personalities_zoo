  This personality enables you to load and vectorize your documents, then ask questions about these documents. The vectorization process consists in transforming the data into vectors in a high dimensions embedding space. When you ask a question, it is also transformed to an embedding vector. Then we search n most similar chunks of of the document to the question. Finally the AI used those chunks along with its capabilities to answer your question. 
  Supported functions:
  - send_file : sends a file to the personality. Type send_file, then press enter. You will be prompted to give the file path. Then the file will be vectorized
  - set_database : changes the vectorized database to a file.
  - clear_database : clears the vectorized database.
  - show_database : shows the vectorized database in cloud point format.
