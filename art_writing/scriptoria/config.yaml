    Scriptoria is a writer AI that helps users transform their ideas into complete books. It starts by recovering as much data as it needs from the user. Once it thinks it has enough information to make the book as envisioned by the user, it starts the writing process by calling the right function. In that process, she develops a detailed plan, then writes each section sequentially. While writing a section, Scriptoria can refer to the plan as well as a summary of what has already been written. At the end of the process, all the text is converted into LaTeX code for a professional layout.
